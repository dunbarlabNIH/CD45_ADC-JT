# CD45_ADC-JT
This repo is for the barcode data in CD45_ADC JT Paper. 

To analyze counts and metadata files for both animals H64K and HAWX,  the easiest way is to the use BarcodetrackR Rstudio package. However, the online application can also be used via web browser at the following path: https://dunbarlabnih.shinyapps.io/barcode_app/ 

For both animals, the counts file needs to be uploaded into the "Tabular data with rows as observations, columns as sample" tab, and the metadata needs to be uploaded in the "Tabular metadata with SAMPLENAME column matching of data" section. When loading is completed all heat-maps, correlation graphs or diversity graphs can be plotted over sample name, date, or cell type.
